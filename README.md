## Table of contents


### contest_1

#### 1. array

Basically same as std::array.

#### 2. big_int

Basic class for long arithmetics.

#### 3. bin_search

Algorithm of binary search. Plain 'n simple.

Basically same as `std::string`. Essentially `vector<char>` -- multiplicative dynamic array for chars only.

#### 5. heap

A bunch of functions for array-style min heap.

#### 6. kth_element

Kth element search (Cormen) with linear(?) time.

#### 7. matrix

Ha-ha linear algebra.

#### 8. merge

Merge two arrays of given types with cast to given output type.

#### 9. multiply

Multiplication of long numbers.

#### 10. rational

Class for rational numbers.

#### 11. sort

Basic quick sort algorithm.

#### 12. string_view

Box class on cstrings.

#### 13. subtract

Subtraction of long numbers.

#### 14. sum

Sum of long numbers.


### contest_2

#### 1.1. convex_polygon

Check is polygon is convex.

#### 1.2. distance

Calculate distance from `Point` to `Line`, `Ray` or `Segment`.

#### 1.3. distance_sections

Calculate distance between two `Segment`.

#### 1.4. dots

Some calculations with `Point` (?)

#### 1.5. graham

`GrahamScan` algorithm for building convex hulls.

#### 1.6. jarvis

`JarvisMarch` algorithm for building convex hulls.

#### 1.7. lines

Calculate distance if two `Line` are parallel and intersection otherwise.

#### 1.8. point_in_polygon

Check if point is inside of polygon. Kinda straightforward, isn't it?

#### 1.9. sect_intersection

Check if two `Segment` intersect.

#### 1.10. surface

Calculate area of polygon. (Why surface? lol)

#### 1.11. vector

Geometrical `Vector`.

#### 2.1. any

Box `Any` class for any class type.

#### 2.2. geometry

Basic geometry class.

#### 2.3. shared_ptr

Clone of `std::shared_ptr`. (It's messed up for some reason as written there)

#### 2.4. tokenize

It was supposed to be tokenizer for calculator project.

#### 2.5. unique_ptr

Clone of `std::unique_ptr`.


### contest_3

Reversed iteration through an array.

#### 2.2. unordered_set

Set class based on hash table.

#### 2.3. vector

Clone of `std::vector` with `Iterator` provided.

Building treap aka cartesian tree.

#### 7. J_BST & K_sum

Using cartesian trees to count sums (?)
